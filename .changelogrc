**New Release Update :tada:**

## 11-09-2021

**Image** `v1.0.20`

- Fix issue where onload doesn't get called when using srcset
- If the user doesn't provide a `fallbackSrc` or a `fallback` `ignoreFallback` is
  applied by default

**Avatar** `v1.2.10`

- Fix issue where avatar blinks during API call due to its fallback logic. You can
  disable the fallback logic by setting `ignoreFallback`, just like you can with
  the `Image` component

**Provider** `v1.6.8`

- Resolve dependency issues caused by previous release
- Add `ChakraProviderProps` type what was removed in previous release

**Modal** `v1.8.12`

- Drawer: omit the `motionPreset` prop type since `Drawer` only implements the
  `Slide` transition, unlike `Modal` that allows you switch its motion preset.

**Menu** `v1.7.4`

- Fix issue where keyboard navigation doesn't work when `MenuButton` isn't
  rendered. This is useful in scenarios where you want the menu to be triggered by
  a command or right-click.

**Button** `v1.4.3`

- Fix issue where composing `Button` with framer-motion's `motion` factory breaks
  animation/transition

**Select** `v1.1.15`

- The disabled state of the `SelectIcon` can be reflected by a disabled
  `FormControl` or by the `isDisabled`-flag of the `select` field
